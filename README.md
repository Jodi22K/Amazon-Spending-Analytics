# **Exploratory Spending Analysis: How Much Have I Spent on Amazon?**

### 

**Executive Summary:**
This project is an exploratory analysis of Amazon spending trends using **Excel** and **Python** Over the years, with frequent Amazon purchases, this analysis provides insights into spending habits, categories, and changes over time. I extracted order data, cleaned and transformed it, then visualized spending trends with the goal of identifying patterns and making data-driven recommendations to optimize future purchasing decisions.

The analysis revealed key trends, such as spending spikes during holiday seasons and high rates of return/general dissatisfaction with various product categories. Based on these insights, I recommend strategies to better manage my spending and make informed decisions regarding future Amazon purchases.

### **Business Problem:**
Frequent Amazon shopperslike me may not have a clear understanding of their spending habits or how those habits evolve over time. Without visibility into how much is spent on different categories, individuals cannot optimize their purchasing decisions. By analyzing historical spending data, I aim to identify my personal spending patterns and grant guiding insights that will help me to make more conscious purchasing choices.

**Key Questions**:
1. What categories make up the largest portion of spending?
2. How does spending change over time (e.g., seasonality, sales events)?
3. Can spending trends help forecast future Amazon purchases?

### **Methodology:**
1. **Data Extraction**: Collected raw data from personal Amazon order history (downloaded as CSV).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Used Excel and Python to clean the data by handling missing values, standardizing category names, and eliminating irrelevant or incomplete data points.
3. **Data Analysis**: Queried the dataset using SQL to generate insights such as total spend per category and trends over time - built visualizations showcasing data with year-over-year spending, category breakdowns, and spending by month. in Python

#### **Key Steps**:
**Excel**:
   - Cleaned the dataset to correct inconsistencies, standardize category names, and fill missing data.

**Python**:
   - Utilized **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **NumPy** to further analyze the data, performing trend analysis and visualizing key metrics like monthly spend and top categories.

### **Skills**:
- **Excel**: Cpeaning, aggregate functions, data transformation, Pivot Tables
- **Python**: Proficiency in Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for plotting spending trends, and NumPy for additional numerical analysis.

### **Results & Insights**:
The analysis provided clear insights into my Amazon spending trends:

1. **Spending Peaks**: There are consistent spikes in spending during major sale events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday seasons.
2. **Top Categories**: The majority of my spending was concentrated in categories like electronics and digital products, with lower spending on physical goods over time.
3. **Monthly Trends**: There is a clear monthly pattern, where spending increases in Q4 and during sales events but decreases in early months of the year.

### **Recommendations**:
1. **Budget Awareness**: Set spending limits based on historical trends to avoid overspending during high-volume periods (e.g., holidays).
2. **Category-Based Spending**: Focus on essential categories and limit impulse purchases, especially in categories with rising costs (e.g., electronics).
3. **Optimize Sale Purchases**: Use trend data to strategically plan purchases during sales events, optimizing savings and reducing unnecessary spending.

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. **A/B Test Budgeting Strategies**: Experiment with setting category-specific budgets and track how spending behavior changes over time.
2. **Long-Term Spending Forecast**: Use Python to build a basic predictive model that forecasts spending patterns based on historical data and upcoming sales events.

By understanding historical spending behavior and leveraging data insights, individuals can make more informed decisions about their future Amazon purchases.

# **Exploratory Spending Analysis: How Much Have I Spent on Amazon?**

### 

**Executive Summary:**
This project is an exploratory analysis of Amazon spending trends using **Excel** and **Python** Over the years, after frequent Amazon purchases, this analysis provides insights into my family's general spending habits, categories, and changes over time. I extracted personal order data, cleaned and transformed it, then visualized spending trends with the goal of identifying patterns and making data-driven recommendations to optimize future purchasing decisions.

The analysis revealed key trends, such as category patterns in accessories, electronics, and beauty, spending spikes during during mid-summer and new-year seasons, and increasing volumes of returns over time, indicating increasing dissatisfaction. Based on these insights, I recommend strategies to better manage my spending and make informed decisions regarding future Amazon purchases.

### **Business Problem:**
Frequent Amazon shoppers like myself may not have a clear understanding of their spending habits or how those habits evolve over time. Without visibility into how much is spent on different categories, individuals cannot optimize their purchasing decisions. By analyzing historical spending data, we aim to identify spending patterns and provide insights to help users make more conscious purchasing choices.

**Key Questions**:
1. What categories make up the largest portion of spending?
2. How does spending change over time (e.g., seasonality, sales events)?
3. Can spending trends help forecast future Amazon purchases?

### **Methodology:**
1. **Data Extraction**: Collected raw data from personal Amazon order history (downloaded as CSV).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Used Excel and Python to clean the data by handling missing values, standardizing category names, and eliminating irrelevant or incomplete data points.
3. **Data Analysis**: Queried the dataset using SQL to generate insights such as total spend per category and trends over time - built visualizations showcasing data with seasonality, year-over-year spending, category breakdowns, correlation charts, and hottest spending days in Python.

#### **Key Steps**:
**Excel**:
   - Cleaned the dataset to correct inconsistencies, standardize category names, and fill missing data. 

**Python**:
   - Utilized **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to further analyze the data, performing trend analysis and visualizing key metrics like monthly spend and top categories.

### **Skills**:
- **Excel**: Utilization for basic cleaning and Pivot tables for data transformation.
- **Python**: Proficiency in Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for plotting spending trends, and Seaborn for additional visual appeal.

### **Results & Insights**:
The analysis provided clear insights into my Amazon spending trends:

1. **Spending Peaks**: There are consistent spikes in spending during major sale events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday seasons.
2. **Top Categories**: The majority of my spending was concentrated in categories like electronics, clothing, beauty/skincare, and home, with lower spending on games and health & wellness over time.
3. **Monthly Trends**: There is a clear monthly pattern, where spending has historical highs during specific summer and fall months (e.g may, June, October - correlation to holiday and summer events) and is lower during February, March, August & November.

---

### **Recommendations**:
1. **Budget Awareness**: Set spending limits based on historical trends to avoid overspending during high-volume periods - pay attention to seasonality (e.g., controlling excess spending during summer months/holidays).
2. **Category-Based Spending**: Focus on essential categories and limit impulse purchases, especially in categories with rising costs (e.g., electronics).
3. **Optimize Sale Purchases**: Use trend data to strategically budget/plan hefty spend purchases before summer months, reduce purchase volumes in beauty/personal care, and take close notice to continue optimizing future savings for meaningful/lasting impacts in health & wellness, whilst reducing general miscellaneous/unnecessary spending.

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. **A/B Test Budgeting Strategies**: Experiment with setting category-specific budgets and track how spending behavior changes over time.
2. **Long-Term Spending Forecast**: Use Python to build a basic predictive model that forecasts spending patterns based on historical data and upcoming sales events.
